# Forecast of HRC Export Prices in China, Japan/Korea and Landed Prices in India
This project seeks to develop a forecasting model for Hot Rolled Coil (HRC) export prices from China, Japan/Korea for 2025. The forecasting model integrates key economic and market factors 
affecting HRC export prices, including the costs of raw materials like coking coal, iron ore, and scrap, as well as industry growth indicators. These insights are visualized through an 
interactive dashboard that displays forecasted trends and relevant macroeconomic drivers. 

Additionally, the dashboard incorporates a tool for calculating import parity landed prices in India. This feature accounts for various costs, enabling the user to assess the competitiveness of 
imported steel compared to domestic prices. While static, the final dashboard presents comprehensive visualizations of forecasted HRC prices for 2025 and landed costs, providing the user with 
valuable insights for pricing strategies and competitive positioning in the market.

## How to run the dashboard
In order to reproduce the forecasting results and generate the corresponding dashboard, the user may follow the steps outlined below. These instructions assume that the user has a basic Python environment setup.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment
2. Install required libraries using `pip install - r requirements.txt`
3. Navigate to the `notebook` folder and enter the following command: `streamlit run app.py` in the terminal
